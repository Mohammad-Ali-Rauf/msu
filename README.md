# 🌟 Zabān-e-Sulaimāni: Building Modern Standard Urdu (MSU)

> *"Urdu can shine again — clear, organized, and connected to our heritage."*

Zabān-e-Sulaimāni is a linguistic initiative to refine and standardize Urdu for the modern world. Our goal is to develop **Modern Standard Urdu (MSU)** — a respectful, structured, and elegant form that bridges classical beauty with contemporary clarity.

---

## 📌 What Is MSU?

**Modern Standard Urdu (MSU)** is a formal, purified form of Urdu designed for:

* 🧠 Intellectual clarity
* 🕋 Religious expression
* 📚 Academic and literary excellence
* 🤖 Technological integration

MSU draws from Arabic grammar, Persian elegance, and Urdu’s poetic soul — while avoiding colonial slang, casual Hinglish, and film-style language.

> *"MSU is a bridge between the past, present, and our shared linguistic future."*

## 🌐 MSU: A Unifying Language

Like Modern Standard Arabic, MSU provides Urdu speakers with a **shared formal standard**:

* Bridges historical, classical, and modern Urdu
* Enables formal reading and writing **without losing dialects or poetry**
* Supports **education, literature, technology, and da’wah**

---

## ❗ Why MSU Matters

Urdu today faces challenges:

* ☠️ Widespread Hinglish and Bollywood slang
* 🧠 Weak grammar in academic, legal, or scientific writing
* 🪦 Reduced connection to Qur’anic and classical intellectual traditions

MSU aims to:

* 🎓 Strengthen Urdu in education, da’wah, and media
* 🧬 Restore clarity, dignity, and cultural depth
* 📜 Preserve the beauty and soul of Urdu for future generations

## 📚 Historical Foundation

MSU is inspired by classical and reformist Urdu literature:

| Author                      | Contribution                                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Wali Dakni**              | Early classical Urdu, rich in Persian style     |
| **Hali**                    | Moral and philosophical prose, Urdu’s evolution |
| **Sir Syed Ahmad Khan**     | Educational reformer, modernized Urdu usage     |
| **Allama Iqbal**            | Poetic and intellectual depth                   |
| **Faiz Ahmed Faiz**         | Modern poetry, idioms, and expressive style     |
| **Ahmed Faraz**             | Contemporary literary flair                     |
| **Baba-e-Urdu (Abdul Haq)** | Advocate for Urdu’s purity and preservation     |

These figures shape MSU’s vocabulary, grammar, and stylistic principles.

## 🏛️ Modern Foundation

To make MSU practical today, we study:

* Urdu children’s stories — simple sentences, everyday words, pronunciation, and basic grammar

This ensures MSU is **grounded in practical language** for reading, writing, and teaching.

---

## 🛠️ Project Approach

### 📖 Codify Grammar

* Define rules for tenses, sentence structure, and formal usage
* Include **Hinglish → MSU examples**:

**Example:**

* Hinglish: “Mujhe kaam karna hai”
* MSU: “مجھے اپنا کام کرنا ہے”
* Notes: Maintains clarity, formal grammar, and dignity

---

### 📘 Build Purified Vocabulary

* Develop a **200,000+ word list**
* Tag roots for clarity: `[AR]` Arabic, `[FA]` Persian, `[TU]` Turkish, `[UR]` Native Urdu
* Future: **color-coded or icon-based system** for digital ease

---

### 🖋️ Develop Style Guide

* Guidance for essays, khutbahs, media, and academic writing
* **Tone markers**: formal, poetic, religious — helping writers switch context while staying MSU-compliant

---

## 🎯 MSU in Action

**Example Paragraph (Modern Urdu → MSU)**

**Modern:**
“Hum school ja rahe hain aur kal project submit karna hai, lekin time kam hai.”

**MSU:**
“ہم اسکول جا رہے ہیں اور کل اپنا منصوبہ جمع کرنا ہے، مگر وقت کم ہے۔”

> Notice: MSU keeps sentence clear, grammatically correct, and elegant.

---

## 🌟 Community Engagement: “MSU Challenge”

* Convert Hinglish/modern Urdu sentences into MSU
* Submit examples for review and public display
* Gamify learning and adoption among youth
